<<<<<<< HEAD
        <p>My name is Zhang Yuan, I am interested in Computer Graphics and Artificial Intelligence, especially the applications based on these technologies which can be used in movie and game industry. I got my Bachelor degree with Honor from Sichuan University in 2015. Now I am working on my Master degree in Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing. After july 2018, I'll join Microsoft STCA.

        <p>The longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind. These passions, like great winds, have blown me hither and thither, in a wayward course, over a great ocean of anguish. From Bertrand Russell.</p>

        <h1>Manster's Project</h1>

        <h2>Project Human</h2>
        <p>This is my major project during my grauate program. This project is divided into several parts, including Human Segmentation in Images, Parameterized Human Model, Model Registration based on RealSense.</p>
        
        <h3>Human Segmentation in Images</h3>
        <p>To extract human contour in still images, we propose a human contour extraction method based on skeleton matching. Skeleton key points are points representing human skeleton in images. Through skeleton key points and color information from images, using human body morphology as prior knowledge, we find optimal human contour key points corresponding to skeleton key points by constructing hidden markov model. Few human contour key points can generate reasonable human contour. Then we use hermite interpolation to connect these key points and obtain human contour. Through experiments, our method can extract reasonable human contour in simple scene, compared to previous methods, our method has a higher speed, and obtains better results in complicated scene. Related article is published on ChinaVR: Human Contour Extraction Based on Skeleton Matching.</p>

        <h3>Parameterized Human Model</h3>
        <p>I implement SIGGRAPH Paper, SCAPE: Shape Completion and Animation of People using Python. After applying Linear Regression and Principal Component Analysis, we can generate reasonable human model using parameters.</p>

        <h3>Model Registration based on RealSense</h3>
        <p>We build a pre-processing system for human depth acquisition using RealSense,it can be applied in scenes such as human modeling and measurement effectively. Related paper is coming soon. </p>

        <h2>Project Camera Sync</h2>
        <p>This project is my favorite work, we propose a perfect camera sync method on cheap CCD camera, related paper is published on Sensors: Stroboscope Based Synchronization of Full Frame CCD Sensors. </p>
        <img src = "sync.PNG" src = "camera sync">

        <h2>Project Linear Algebra Solver</h2>
        <p>This project includes some materials and codes about linear algebra and its applications. For linear algebra, I recommend Matrix Analysis and Applied Linear Algebra by Carl D. Meyer, I provide some implementations of matrix decomposition methods and their corresponding applications. </p>
