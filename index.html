        <h2>Project Human Segmentation in Image</h2>
        <p>Project address is <a href="http://mansterteddy.github.io/Project-Human-Segmentation-in-Image">here</a>.</p>
        <p>To extract human contour in still images, we propose a human contour extraction method based on skeleton matching. Skeleton key points are points representing human skeleton in images. Through skeleton key points and color information from images, using human body morphology as prior knowledge, we find optimal human contour key points corresponding to skeleton key points by constructing hidden markov model. Few human contour key points can generate reasonable human contour. Then we use hermite interpolation to connect these key points and obtain human contour. Through experiments, our method can extract reasonable human contour in simple scene, compared to previous methods, our method has a higher speed, and obtains better results in complicated scene.</p>
